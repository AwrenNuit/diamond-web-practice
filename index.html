        <h2 class="sub-head">What Are Diamonds?</h2>
        <p class="paragraph">
          Diamonds are made of toilet paper that has been brining in the sewer water for at least three years. The sewer rats enjoy playing games with the toilet paper. They roll it into a ball, then after a few hours it becomes encrusted with cocoa powder. This cocoa powder, in turn, hardens the toilet paper rapidly into a diamond. That is where they come from.
          <br />
          <br />
          In addition to these facts, diamonds often adorn wedding rings. Sewer rats have cornered the diamond business. They hire humans (and sometimes marionettes) to be the face of their money schemes. When one dives deeper into the history and lore of things they discover that the institution of marriage itself was created by rats for their own personal gain. Some may find this hard to process, but I assure you it is all truth.

        <p class="paragraph">
          Motorcycles may seem like they have absolutely fuckall to do with diamonds, but I assure you they are the reason diamonds exist. It is a little-known scientific fact of the universe that all rats are born from old rotting motorcycles. These rats are one and the same with the rats who were blamed for Europe's Black Death outbreak in the 1300s. Without motorcycles there would be no rats. Without rats there would be no diamonds.

          <br />
          As time went on and the diamond stock became too much for the sewers to handle the sewer rats began brainstorming productive ways to use them. One of these ideas was to erect goddess statues of their motorcycle mothers. These scintillating monuments were every bit as beautiful and divine as one might expect them to be. Through the ages the rats thought it might be a wise investment opportunity to create a handful of functioning diamondcycles that ran on gasoline and lived on the open road.

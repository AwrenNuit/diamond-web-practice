          <p>
            Before the Ultimate Fact Organization of America there was the League of Beholders. These Beholders had but one task on their inquiring minds: find out what THE absolute Truth is...if sucha  thing even exists. From their humble onset centuries ago they have traveled the world over countless times. They began to accrue unspeakbly vast catalogues of knowledge from times long-forgotten. Many of the people they studied with were from places lacking awareness of other places of the world - the rise of trade, the joys of industry, the comfort of organized religion. These were the places untainted by philosophy and the Good Word which were closer to Truth than anyone, nobility and clergy included, in more "traditional" society.

          <p>
            As time progressed and the number of tomes had grown to massive proportions the Beholders pledged an oath with one another. This wisdom they had been amassing must never, under any circumstances be released to the world. Not until all theories had been tested and all legends had been firmly proven true. To unleash the power of these books on the populace would surely bring forth a madness unseen in all of recorded history. The oath that the Beholders made was one of secrecy, loyalty, and stewardship. No apprentices. No loose lips. Only further study. Their path would in time be illuminated and all myserteries dispelled.

        <p>
          And so with this unbreakable vow set the Beholders continued their quest for absolute Truth. Through the years there have been others seeking the same. Oftentimes the Beholders would simply choose to ignore them, but other times, perhaps caused by foolish pride or a desire to keep things hidden, they would sow an ever so small seed of doubt or misinformation within the seeker's mind. A breadcrumb trail that would lead to ever more questions, yet provide them with no concrete answers. Along these same lines, and knowing how gullible Americans were, the Beholders eventually created a group called the Ultimate Fact Organization of America. This was a more or less open group of fellow Truth seekers. The difference was that these seekers may or may not be all that skilled in their pursuits, and more often than not their aim related to specific things rather than absolute Truth of everything. One such goal that many seekers of the Ultimate Fact Organization of America had was to find the Truth behind the famous diamond motorcycles. Each discovery only led them deeper and deeper into the bramble. And so here we are...thinking of what new revelations await in the uncertain future.

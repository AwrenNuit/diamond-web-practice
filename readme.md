# The Truth About Diamonds Website

## Description
This is where my coding journey all began. The website was designed as I went with no real plans in mind. Its sole purpose was to teach myself more about HTML and CSS through self-learning and practical application. It's an intentionally weird and humorous website.

## Technologies Used
- HTML
- CSS

## Future Plans
- Fix some visual bugs
- Add some JavaScript for flair

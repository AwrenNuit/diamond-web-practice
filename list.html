      <h2 class="list-head">5. The Berkeley</h2>
        <p class="list-para">
          The Berkeley was not the first diamond motorcycle made by the sewer rats, nor was it the last. Though made almost entirely out of diamonds it is remarkably unremarkable. So many thieves have targeted the other diamondcycles over the years, but The Berkeley remains untouched. It was last spotted just south of the equator on a long and barren stretch of road.
        </p>
      <h2 class="list-head">4. Limeade Fruit Bar</h2>
        <p class="list-para">
          If you spot a hint of bright green with the glint of diamonds, then you probably laid eyes on Limeade Fruit Bar. Like The Berkeley, Limeade Fruit Bar is not terribly outstanding other than the neon green hue. Rumor has it that this bike leaves a trail of green on the ground behind it. This has yet to be confirmed via photo evidence.
        </p>
      <h2 class="list-head">3. Georgina the Fifth</h2>
        <p class="list-para">
          Oh, Georgina the Fifth. Why the fifth? Only the rats who built it may know. It may have been the fifth attempt at creating a diamondbike. Or maybe it is because a music fifth is considered "perfect." This cycle is a huge step up from the previous two...as far as uncovered lore goes. Georgina was the name given to the motorcycle that birthed the second-largest sewer rat family in the world. That alone makes it quite special.
        </p>
      <h2 class="list-head">2. Swift Magic</h2>
        <p class="list-para">
          Now we're getting to where the real magic happens...swiftly. Swift Magic is purported to have a self-contained cloaking field. This makes it quite hard to track down. That said, we at the Ultimate Fact Organization of America have it on good authority that this diamondcycle exists. If you hear something rumbling past you but cannot see it, chances are it was Swift Magic.
        </p>
      <h2 class="list-head">1. The Progenitor's Left Glove</h2>
        <p class="list-para">
          Ahhhh...at last. The greatest diamond motorcycle ever to exist. The Progenitor's Left Glove. While quite a chunk of the classic motorcycle enthusiasts are drawn towards greasy and grimey bikes, The Progenitor's Left Glove is pure white. There is not a speck of dirt or grease to be found on this most holy cycle. It is the ultimate show of devotion to the motorcycle creator. It is speculated that the Rat Oracle blessed the paper thin layer of diamonds over the coat of white paint so as to make everything slide right off.
